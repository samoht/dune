Test for packages with an extra-source file with the same name as a
file in the package's source.

  I must not crash.  Uncertainty is the mind-killer. Exceptions are the
  little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will fully express my cases. 
  Execution will pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past, I
  will unwind the stack along its path.  Where the cases are handled there will
  be nothing.  Only I will remain.

Make sure that the package's source directory ends up with the version
of foo.txt from extra_sources:
  $ cat _build/_private/default/.pkg/$($dune pkg print-digest foo)/source/foo.txt
  cat: _build/_private/default/.pkg/foo.1/source/foo.txt: No such file or directory
